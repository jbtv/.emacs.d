PROBLEMS/MYSTERIES

why does ,bd not work in *Messages* buffer even though motion keys work, and after dis/re-enabling evil-mode ,bd starts working
similar to whatever was bad about my first attempt at magit+evil
*Completions* buffer is fucked ... no motion keys .. major mode is completion

MAGIT still needs work
!!!
 FIX THIS
  my magit bindings like ,a seem to be in the wrong keymap
  they need to apply only to magit-mode buffers
  I want ,a for align-regexp

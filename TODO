bind:

magit-ediff ... whatever mode that is I nuked it's default bindings
  need a, b, n, p, q -> find out where these are

https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el <-- looks good to me, manage these extra buffers *Messages* *Completions* etc ... but doesn't have an elpa package?

PYTHON TODO
https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi-direx <-- no elpa
https://github.com/m2ym/direx-el
How to automate M-x run-python? should it run one per buffer? probably not <-- elpy solves this, read about it
http://elpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

--> better lisp editing <--
figure out what I want from my smartparens bindings

I might like to have completions from an english dictionary in some mode for editing docs, and perhaps it is possible to enable it in comments? ditto spellcheck and autofix typos... maybe

switching to the right buffer (lots of features, horrible bindings)
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles_-_Buffer-Name_Input


e.g. set mode for certain file extensions
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Capfile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Gemfile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Rakefile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rake\\'" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rb\\'" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ru\\'" . ruby-mode))

PROBLEMS/MYSTERIES

why does ,bd not work in *Messages* buffer even though motion keys work, and after dis/re-enabling evil-mode ,bd starts working
similar to whatever was bad about my first attempt at magit+evil
*Completions* buffer is fucked ... no motion keys .. major mode is completion

MAGIT still needs work
!!!
 FIX THIS
  my magit bindings like ,a seem to be in the wrong keymap
  they need to apply only to magit-mode buffers
  I want ,a for align-regexp

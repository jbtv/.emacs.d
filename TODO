bind:

get rid of whatever is bound to "n" in magit modes ... I do indeed want next-search or whatever
get rid of the 1234 bindings in magit ... clobbers evil-motion
bind something to 'magit-blame-mode and something to 'magit-blame-locate-commit

https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el <-- looks good to me, manage these extra buffers *Messages* *Completions* etc

PYTHON TODO
FUCK it is annoying that motion keys are not working in elpy-config Custom-mode buffer

How to automate M-x run-python? should it run one per buffer? probably not

I might like to have completions from an english dictionary in some mode for editing docs, and perhaps it is possible to enable it in comments? ditto spellcheck and autofix typos... maybe

switching to the right buffer (lots of features, horrible bindings)
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles_-_Buffer-Name_Input


e.g. set mode for certain file extensions
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Capfile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Gemfile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Rakefile" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rake\\'" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rb\\'" . ruby-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ru\\'" . ruby-mode))

PROBLEMS/MYSTERIES

why does ,bd not work in *Messages* buffer even though motion keys work, and after dis/re-enabling evil-mode ,bd starts working
similar to whatever was bad about my first attempt at magit+evil
*Completions* buffer is fucked ... no motion keys .. major mode is completion

MAGIT still needs work
my magit bindings like ,a seem to be in the wrong keymap
they need to apply only to magit-mode buffers
